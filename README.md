# Hello.html

# My first Project 
---------

It was a really **incredible** and **interesting** project! You may think that I'm kidding but it's true!

- I tried to create site with _links_ and ***images***
- My site is an interactive. 
  - You may click any link. 
  - ~~even registered~~ .
 - ~~Example Javascript~~. Honestly, I knew only one Javascript at that moment.
```javascript
// Code 
alert ("Hello World!")
``` 
but **Confucius** said: 
> Even the way in thousand miles start from the first step

So, May I suppose you want to visit this incredible site? Here you are! ~~Only today and only for you~~ [My Site] [1]

[1]: https://index.html

Obviously you have some troubles and can't visit this link, it is not exist. It was a joke. **ha-ha-ha** 


Any way, I can show you this photo at least.

##Total

I spent around 10 hours for my project and hope in future I will do it faster and better.
